# Mistral_LLM_Colloquial
This project focuses on fine-tuning the Mistral-7B model to convert standard Malayalam text into its colloquial (spoken) form. The goal is to build an AI model that understands formal Malayalam and generates natural, everyday spoken Malayalam, making it more useful for chatbots, virtual assistants, and conversational AI applications.
